ABSTRACT
Detecting critical transitions in collective systems from limited data is a central challenge in
complex systems science. Traditional methods often require knowledge of control parameters
and access to global system states, while typical machine learning approaches rely on multiagent snapshots. Here, we introduce a novel, blind methodology to identify criticality in
collective motion using only single-agent trajectory data. Our approach quantifies the temporal
fluctuation in the predictive certainty of a sequence model (RWKV-7) tasked with forecasting
an agent’s movement. This metric, the predictive entropy variance (Var(𝐻)), is hypothesized to
peak at the transition. We rigorously test this method on the Vicsek model. Our results show
that Var(𝐻) exhibits a sharp peak that accurately identifies the critical region, significantly
outperforming a simpler statistical benchmark. Crucially, the method proves to be versatile:
it successfully detects the transition in both low-density (𝜌 = 0.5) and high-density (𝜌 = 2.0)
regimes. Furthermore, a model trained on data from the smallest system (L=32) demonstrates
remarkable generalization, correctly identifying the critical point in larger systems (up to
L=256) and even across different physical regimes. This work establishes predictive entropy
variance as a robust, data-driven indicator for criticality, offering a powerful tool for analyzing
complex systems from purely local observations.

1. Introduction
Collective motion phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and society [1–3]. Examples span biological scales, from bacterial
swarms and biofilms where individuals coordinate motility [4] and collective cell migrations crucial for tissue development and
wound healing [5], to the canonical examples of bird flocks and fish schools. Such coordination principles are also actively
studied and engineered in artificial systems, like autonomous robot swarms designed for exploration or cooperative tasks [6], and
provide frameworks for understanding complex human and social dynamics, including pedestrian crowds, vehicular traffic, and the
formation and spread of collective opinions [7]. These systems often exhibit complex emergent behaviors, such as spontaneous
pattern formation and coordinated large-scale movement, arising from simple local interactions among individual constituents.
Understanding the principles governing these non-equilibrium systems is a central challenge in statistical physics and complex
systems science.
A particularly fruitful paradigm for studying collective motion has been the investigation of phase transitions between distinct
macroscopic states, analogous to equilibrium phase transitions. The Vicsek model (VM), introduced in 1995 [8], has become a
cornerstone in this field. In its simplest form, it describes point particles moving at a constant speed that tend to align their direction

of motion with their local neighbors, subject to a certain level of noise. Despite its simplicity, the VM exhibits a rich phenomenology.
It displays a kinetic transition from a disordered, gas-like state at high noise to a state of collective motion (flocking) with longrange polar order at low noise, a phenomenon theoretically predicted by hydrodynamic theories [9,10] and extensively studied
numerically [11]. The precise nature of this transition, particularly whether it is continuous or discontinuous (first-order), has been
a subject of considerable research and debate, often depending on factors like density and specific model variants, with evidence
suggesting complex behavior potentially involving inhomogeneous states like bands or phase separation, especially when density
fluctuations are coupled [11–13]. Studying this transition provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms of self-organization
in active matter systems [14,15].
Traditionally, the phase transition in the VM and related models is characterized by simulating the system across a range of
the control parameter, typically the noise amplitude 𝜂, and measuring a global order parameter, such as the average particle
polarization (or magnetization) 𝛷 [8,11]. The transition point or critical region is often identified by analyzing the behavior
of 𝛷 or its susceptibility 𝜒 = 𝑁(⟨𝛷2 ⟩ − ⟨𝛷⟩2 ), which is expected to peak near criticality. These standard measures have been
widely employed in detailed numerical characterizations of the transition [11,12,16]. More recently, information-theoretic quantities
like the full system’s entropy have also been successfully employed to detect and characterize these transitions [17,18]. While
powerful, this standard approach faces significant limitations when considering real-world systems. Firstly, it relies critically on the
ability to precisely know and systematically vary the control parameter (𝜂). However, in many biological, social, or ecological
systems, the effective ‘‘noise’’ or equivalent governing parameters are often unknown, intrinsically fluctuating, or simply not
externally controllable, posing major challenges for model parameterization, validation and dealing with inherent parameter
uncertainty [19–21]. Secondly, calculating global order parameters necessitates access to the states (e.g., position and velocity) of a
large fraction, if not all, individuals in the system simultaneously. While parameter-independent measures like the Binder cumulant
are powerful for locating critical points from global snapshots, they still rely on this very assumption of system-wide data access.
This level of global data acquisition is often infeasible in practice due to observational constraints such as occlusion, large group
sizes, and limited sensor range [22–24].
The inherent difficulties in applying traditional modeling frameworks to complex real-world systems actively motivate the search
for alternative methodologies. Specifically, challenges such as reliably inferring interaction rules or parameters from often noisy or
incomplete empirical observations of collective behavior [25,26], and overcoming practical observational constraints that limit
access to comprehensive, system-wide data [22,23], underscore the need for new approaches. Consequently, there is a growing
emphasis on developing data-driven techniques capable of analyzing system behavior based primarily on available measurements,
as seen in fields grappling with complex dynamics like disaster resilience [27], alongside parameter-agnostic frameworks such as
equation-free modeling [28]. The goal is to devise methods that can detect critical states or phase transitions using potentially limited
observational data (e.g., from a subset of individuals) without relying on prior knowledge or external control of underlying system
parameters. Such ‘blind identification’ capabilities are particularly valuable, as they offer the potential for monitoring complex
system states and anticipating critical shifts using only accessible time series data [29].
While machine learning (ML) offers powerful tools for analyzing phases [30,31], prominent approaches often analyze spatial
configurations via methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [32–34] or apply unsupervised learning to configuration
snapshots [35,36]. Such methods frequently rely on analyzing system-wide or global configuration data, which inherently requires
simultaneous state information from many agents across the system. Furthermore, some ML strategies operate within supervised
frameworks, for instance, training classifiers to distinguish between phases, which necessitates labeled data (i.e., knowing which
phase each configuration belongs to) and thus potentially inherits limitations regarding parameter dependence [37]. In stark
contrast, our work explores the potential of using only the information embedded within the temporal dynamics of a single agent’s
trajectory. While the principle of ergodicity suggests that a single long trajectory theoretically contains information about the system’s
collective states, the practical challenge lies in extracting this subtle information effectively. Simple statistical analyses often fail
to reveal the signature of a collective phase transition, a point we will demonstrate explicitly in this work. This motivates a shift
in perspective: instead of relying on global snapshots, can we infer collective properties from the much more accessible data of a
single trajectory? Encouragingly, recent work has shown that it is indeed possible to infer global properties, such as the size of a
collective, purely from the statistical analysis of a single unit’s random motion [38]. Building upon this principle, our work explores
the potential of using the rich temporal dynamics embedded within a single agent’s trajectory not just to infer static properties,
but to detect the dynamic signature of a collective critical transition. We propose a fundamentally different approach that moves
beyond direct statistical analysis of the trajectory itself. Instead, we focus on probing the dynamic predictability of the agent’s motion
by leveraging a sequence model. We hypothesize that the characteristic fluctuations and complex dynamics near a critical region will
cause the predictive certainty of an appropriate sequence model to vary significantly over time, and that this variation, quantified by
the variance of the predictive Shannon entropy, will exhibit a distinct peak signaling proximity to criticality. This approach quantifies
the fluctuations in the learnability of the dynamics, a higher-order feature that we posit is a highly sensitive signature of criticality.
Capturing the subtle temporal patterns underlying this hypothesis necessitates powerful sequence modeling. While architectures
like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were developed to mitigate challenges such as the vanishing gradient problem
inherent in simpler recurrent networks [39,40], effectively capturing dependencies over very long sequences can still pose difficulties
for these models. The Transformer architecture [41] significantly advanced capabilities for handling long-range dependencies,
primarily through its attention mechanism. However, this mechanism typically incurs computational complexity that scales
quadratically with the sequence length, potentially limiting its applicability to the extremely long time series that might be required
to fully capture phenomena like critical slowing down near phase transitions.

Efficient architectures like the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model [42–45] have emerged aiming to bridge this gap,
offering linear computational scaling suitable for very long sequences while incorporating sophisticated state-updating mechanisms.
We specifically employ the recent RWKV-7 variant [45]. Its potential suitability for modeling critical dynamics stems from several
factors: (i) Its linear complexity allows for the efficient processing of the long sequences necessary to potentially capture the extended
temporal correlations arising from critical slowing down. (ii) Its enhanced theoretical expressive power and state-tracking capabilities
compared to certain classes of recurrent models [46,47], attributed to its non-diagonal, delta-rule-based state updates [45], offer
promise for modeling the potentially complex, non-trivial history dependence characteristic of the critical region.
Leveraging this well-suited architecture, our methodology involves training dedicated RWKV-7 models on composite datasets of
single-agent trajectories from different physical regimes of the Vicsek model. By calculating the variance of the Shannon entropy of
the model’s sequential predictions, we derive our proposed indicator, Var(𝐻).
The main contributions of this work are threefold: (1) We introduce the predictive entropy variance as a novel indicator for
criticality and demonstrate its effectiveness using only single-agent trajectory data. (2) We validate this indicator against the global
order parameter and prove its superiority over simpler statistical benchmarks. (3) We establish the method’s universality by showing
its success in both low- and high-density regimes, reveal the model’s generalization capabilities across different system sizes, and
confirm its consistency with the principles of finite-size scaling.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 details our extensive simulation protocols, the data preprocessing
steps, the model training strategy, and the formulation of our indicator and benchmarks. Section 3 presents the core results,
systematically demonstrating the indicator’s validation, superiority, universality, and finite-size scaling behavior. Section 4 provides
a physical interpretation of these findings, discusses their broader implications, and outlines future research directions. Finally,
Section 5 provides concluding remarks.
2. Methodology
2.1. The Vicsek model and simulation protocol
We investigate collective motion using the standard two-dimensional Vicsek model with angular noise [8]. The system comprises
𝑁 = 𝜌𝐿2 point particles moving within a square domain of linear size 𝐿 with periodic boundary conditions. To assess the properties
of our proposed method, we performed simulations across different system sizes and particle densities.
Specifically, we focused on two representative density regimes. For a low-density regime (𝜌 = 0.5), simulations were conducted
for system sizes 𝐿 ∈ {32, 64, 128, 256} to investigate the finite-size effects on our indicator. For a high-density regime (𝜌 = 2.0), we
used system sizes of 𝐿 ∈ {32, 64} to test the method’s applicability in a different dynamical context. In all simulations, particles
move with a constant speed 𝑣0 = 1, and the interaction radius is set to 𝑅 = 1.
The system evolves in discrete time steps. At each step 𝑡, particle 𝑖 updates its angle of motion 𝜃𝑖 according to:
⎛ ∑
⎞
𝜃𝑖 (𝑡 + 1) = arg ⎜
𝑒𝑖𝜃𝑗 (𝑡) ⎟ + 𝛥𝜃𝑖 (𝑡),
⎜
⎟
⎝𝑗∈𝑖 (𝑡)
⎠

(1)

where 𝑖 (𝑡) is the set containing particle 𝑖 and its neighbors 𝑗 satisfying 𝑑𝑖𝑗 (𝑡) ≤ 𝑅. The noise term 𝛥𝜃𝑖 (𝑡) is drawn independently for
each particle and time step from a uniform distribution 𝑈 [−𝜂∕2, 𝜂∕2]. The noise amplitude 𝜂 serves as the control parameter, varied
systematically from 0.1 to 4.0 in steps of 𝛥𝜂 = 0.1.
For each parameter set (𝐿, 𝜌, 𝜂), simulations were run for a total of 𝑇𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 100, 000 steps. To ensure measurements were taken
in the statistically stationary state, the initial 𝑇𝑒𝑞 = 50,000 steps were discarded. A total of 𝑁𝑟𝑢𝑛𝑠 = 20 independent simulation runs
were performed for each parameter set, starting from random initial particle positions and orientations.
2.2. Time series acquisition and preprocessing
For each simulation run conducted in the statistically stationary state (𝑡 > 𝑇𝑒𝑞 ), the angular trajectory 𝜃(𝑡) of a single, randomly
selected particle was recorded. This trajectory was sampled every 𝛥𝑡𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 = 50 simulation steps, resulting in a time series containing
𝑇

𝑠𝑒𝑞
𝑇𝑠𝑒𝑞 = 1000 data points per run. We denote this raw sequence as {𝜃(𝑡𝑘 )}𝑘=1
, with angles represented in degrees within the range
[0, 360).
The raw angle time series subsequently underwent two essential preprocessing stages. First, to reduce high-frequency noise
inherent in the stochastic simulation and to allow the model to focus on more persistent directional changes indicative of the
collective state, we employed a vector-averaging Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Each angle 𝜃(𝑡𝑘 ) was initially converted
to radians (𝜃𝑟𝑎𝑑 (𝑡𝑘 ) = 𝜃(𝑡𝑘 ) × 𝜋∕180) and then represented as a 2D unit vector (𝑥𝑘 , 𝑦𝑘 ) = (cos 𝜃𝑟𝑎𝑑 (𝑡𝑘 ), sin 𝜃𝑟𝑎𝑑 (𝑡𝑘 )). An EMA with a
span parameter 𝑊𝐸𝑀𝐴 = 10 was applied independently to the sequences of 𝑥-components {𝑥𝑘 } and 𝑦-components {𝑦𝑘 }, yielding
smoothed component sequences {𝑥̄ 𝑘 } and {𝑦̄𝑘 }. The smoothed angle in radians, 𝜃𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑜𝑡ℎ,𝑟𝑎𝑑 (𝑡𝑘 ), was then reconstructed using the
four-quadrant inverse tangent, arctan2(𝑦̄𝑘 , 𝑥̄ 𝑘 ) (Eq. (2)). Finally, these smoothed radian angles were converted back to degrees and
𝑇𝑠𝑒𝑞
mapped consistently to the [0, 360) range using Eq. (3), yielding the smoothed, continuous angle sequence {𝜃𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑜𝑡ℎ (𝑡𝑘 )}𝑘=1
.

(2)

𝜃𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑜𝑡ℎ,𝑟𝑎𝑑 (𝑡𝑘 ) = arctan2(𝑦̄𝑘 , 𝑥̄ 𝑘 )
𝜃𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑜𝑡ℎ (𝑡𝑘 ) = (𝜃𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑜𝑡ℎ,𝑟𝑎𝑑 (𝑡𝑘 ) × 180∕𝜋 + 360)

(3)

mod 360

T. Wu and Z. Han

Second, following the smoothing procedure, the continuous angles 𝜃𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑜𝑡ℎ (𝑡𝑘 ) were discretized into 𝑁𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑠 = 360 integer values,
corresponding to degrees [0, 359]. This discretization was achieved by rounding the smoothed angle to the nearest integer degree,
employing banker’s rounding for half-integer cases (consistent with ‘numpy.around’), and ensuring the result wraps correctly within
the [0, 𝑁𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑠 − 1] range using the modulo operation, as shown in Eq. (4).
𝜃𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑒 (𝑡𝑘 ) = round(𝜃𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑜𝑡ℎ (𝑡𝑘 ))

mod 𝑁𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑠 .

𝑇𝑠𝑒𝑞
This sequence of preprocessing steps produced the final integer time series {𝜃𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑒 (𝑡𝑘 )}𝑘=1
used as input for the sequence model,
generated for each of the 𝑁𝑟𝑢𝑛𝑠 runs at every noise level 𝜂 for a given system size 𝐿.

2.3. Sequence modeling via RWKV-7
The temporal structure of the discretized angle sequences was modeled using the RWKV-7 architecture [45], a novel sequence
modeling architecture that blends the strengths of Transformers and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). As an RNN, RWKV-7 enjoys
constant memory and computational cost during inference, allowing it to efficiently process arbitrarily long sequences. However,
its design also permits fully parallelizable training, similar to a Transformer. This combination results in a linear time complexity
(𝑂(𝐿)) with respect to sequence length 𝐿, making it an ideal candidate for analyzing the long temporal correlations present in
critical dynamics.
Mechanistically, RWKV-7 features a highly expressive state-updating mechanism based on a generalized ‘‘delta rule’’. A key
distinction from Transformers, whose attention mechanism operates on an immutable Key-Value cache of past states, is that RWKV7’s internal RNN state is mutable and completely recomputed at each timestep. This allows the model to actively ‘‘edit’’ its memory by
selectively adding new information and removing old information on a per-channel basis. This capability for dynamic state tracking
is theoretically powerful — enabling RWKV-7 to solve problems beyond the recognized capabilities of standard Transformers, such
as recognizing all regular languages [45,46]. For our task, this mutable state is particularly advantageous, as it allows the model to
continuously update its ‘‘understanding’’ of the agent’s fluctuating local environment, a crucial feature for capturing the complex,
history-dependent dynamics near a phase transition.
In this work, we employed a specific RWKV-7 model with 𝐿𝑟𝑤𝑘𝑣 = 3 layers, each with a hidden state dimensionality of
𝐷𝑟𝑤𝑘𝑣 = 128. For each density regime (𝜌 = 0.5 and 𝜌 = 2.0), a dedicated model was trained on a composite dataset constructed
by pooling all 𝑁𝑟𝑢𝑛𝑠 × 𝑁𝜂 single-agent sequences generated from the L=32 simulations for that specific density. Importantly, the
model training was conducted blindly, without providing the specific noise value 𝜂 associated with any given training sequence.
The models were trained using an autoregressive objective: at each time step 𝑡𝑘 , predicting the probability distribution of the next
angle 𝜃𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑒 (𝑡𝑘+1 ) given the entire preceding sequence (𝜃𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑒 (𝑡1 ), … , 𝜃𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑒 (𝑡𝑘 )). Training employed the AdamW optimizer [48]
with parameters (𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.99, 𝜖 = 10−18 ). A cosine learning rate schedule [49] was used, decaying from an initial rate of
6 × 10−4 to a final rate of 6 × 10−5 over the training duration, preceded by 10 warmup steps. The models were trained for 3 epochs
with a batch size of 16.
2.4. Quantifying predictability fluctuation: Predictive entropy variance
Once trained, the unified RWKV-7 model was employed in inference mode to analyze the dynamics encoded in individual
𝑇𝑠𝑒𝑞
sequences. For each preprocessed sequence {𝜃𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑒 (𝑡𝑘 )}𝑘=1
, corresponding to a specific simulation run and noise level 𝜂 (although
𝜂 remained unknown to the model during this process), we performed the following analysis. At each time step 𝑘 from 1 to 𝑇𝑠𝑒𝑞 − 1,
𝑁
−1
the model processed the history (𝜃𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑒 (𝑡1 ), … , 𝜃𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑒 (𝑡𝑘 )) to compute the predictive probability distribution 𝑃𝑘 = {𝑝𝑘,𝑖 }𝑖=0𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑠 over
the possible subsequent angles 𝜃𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑒 (𝑡𝑘+1 ). Subsequently, the Shannon entropy 𝐻𝑘 of this distribution was calculated using Eq. (5):
𝑁𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑠 −1

𝐻𝑘 = −

∑

(5)

𝑝𝑘,𝑖 log2 𝑝𝑘,𝑖 ,

𝑖=0

where the term is zero if 𝑝𝑘,𝑖 = 0. This value 𝐻𝑘 quantifies the instantaneous uncertainty or unpredictability of the model’s forecast
at step 𝑘. To capture the fluctuation in this predictability over the entire trajectory, we computed the variance of the resulting
𝑇𝑠𝑒𝑞 −1
entropy sequence {𝐻𝑘 }𝑘=1
according to Eq. (6):
𝑇

Var(𝐻) =

−1

𝑠𝑒𝑞
∑

(𝐻𝑘 − 𝐻)
𝑇𝑠𝑒𝑞 − 2 𝑘=1

−1

𝑇

where 𝐻̄ =

𝑠𝑒𝑞
∑
1
𝐻𝑘 .
𝑇𝑠𝑒𝑞 − 1 𝑘=1

(6)

This variance, Var(𝐻), measures the temporal variability of the predictive uncertainty for a single trajectory.
The primary metric utilized in this study to characterize the system’s behavior as a function of noise is the average entropy
variance, Var(𝐻)(𝜂). This was obtained by averaging the individual Var(𝐻) values over the 𝑁𝑟𝑢𝑛𝑠 = 20 independent simulation runs
conducted for each noise level 𝜂, as defined in Eq. (7):
Var(𝐻)(𝜂) =

1

𝑁𝑟𝑢𝑛𝑠

∑

𝑁𝑟𝑢𝑛𝑠 run=1

Var(𝐻)run,𝜂 .

(7)

We hypothesize that this average entropy variance, Var(𝐻)(𝜂), exhibits distinct behavior, particularly a peak, in the vicinity of the
critical noise region, thereby serving as an indicator of criticality.

2.5. Benchmark metrics and validation
To validate our findings and evaluate the performance of our method, we compared the Var(𝐻) indicator against two distinct
benchmarks.
First, to provide the physical context of the collective phase transition, we computed the global order parameter, the mean
polarization ⟨𝛷⟩. This allows for a direct comparison between the signal detected by our single-agent indicator and the macroscopic
state of the entire system.
Second, to assess the added value of our predictive modeling approach, we introduced a benchmark based on a direct statistical
analysis of the single-agent time series. Specifically, we computed the circular variance of the angular increments for each trajectory.
This provides a baseline to determine if the complex dynamics captured by the sequence model are necessary to identify the critical
region, or if a simpler measure of angular dispersion would suffice.
Circular variance. The circular variance is a measure of the dispersion of angular data, analogous to the linear variance but adapted
𝑇𝑠𝑒𝑞 −1
for periodic quantities. For a set of angular increments {𝛥𝜃𝑘 }𝑘=1
from a single trajectory, we first compute the mean resultant
̄
vector 𝑅:
𝑇

𝑅̄ =

−1

𝑠𝑒𝑞
∑
1
𝑒𝑖𝛥𝜃𝑘 ,
𝑇𝑠𝑒𝑞 − 1 𝑘=1

(8)

̄ quantifies the concentration of the data around the mean angle. The
where the angles are in radians. The length of this vector, |𝑅|,
circular variance, 𝑉 , is then defined as:
̄
𝑉 = 1 − |𝑅|.

(9)

The value of 𝑉 ranges from 0 (all data points are identical) to 1 (data are uniformly distributed on the circle). The final benchmark
metric for each noise level 𝜂 was then obtained by averaging the individual 𝑉 values over the 𝑁𝑟𝑢𝑛𝑠 = 20 independent simulation
runs conducted for that specific 𝜂. This allows for a direct comparison of the information captured by our predictive model versus
a simpler measure of angular dispersion.
3. Results
In this section, we present a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed indicator, the average predictive entropy variance Var(𝐻),
by analyzing its behavior across different system sizes and particle densities. We validate its effectiveness against the global order
parameter and demonstrate its superiority over a simpler statistical benchmark.
3.1. Validation and superiority of the indicator at low density (𝜌 = 0.5)
We first assess our method in the low-density regime (𝜌 = 0.5). Fig. 1 provides a multi-faceted analysis for system sizes L=32 and
L=64. The left panels (a, c) serve as a primary validation, comparing Var(𝐻) with the macroscopic state of the system, represented
by the average polarization ⟨𝛷⟩. For both system sizes, a distinct and sharp peak in Var(𝐻) emerges. Crucially, this peak is precisely
located within the region where the order parameter ⟨𝛷⟩ exhibits its steepest decline, confirming that our single-agent indicator
accurately captures the collective phase transition.
To demonstrate the necessity of our predictive modeling approach, we then compare our indicator against a statisticallymotivated benchmark: the circular variance of the angular increments, derived from the same single-agent trajectories. The right
panels (b, d) of Fig. 1 illustrate this comparison. In stark contrast to Var(𝐻), the circular variance is a featureless, monotonically
increasing function of the noise parameter 𝜂. It fails to provide any signal of the underlying phase transition. This result strongly
suggests that simple statistical measures of trajectory fluctuations are insufficient to detect criticality. Instead, the sophisticated
temporal pattern recognition and predictive capabilities of the sequence model are essential to distill the critical signature from a
single agent’s motion.
3.2. Universality and generalization in the high-density regime (𝜌 = 2.0)
To test the universality of our methodology, we applied it to the high-density regime (𝜌 = 2.0), which exhibits a qualitatively
different transition behavior. A new RWKV-7 model was trained specifically on L=32, 𝜌 = 2.0 data to specialize in this dynamical
context. The results are presented in Fig. 2.
The left panels (a, c) demonstrate the method’s universality. The Var(𝐻) indicator, calculated using the new, specialized
model, again exhibits a clear and sharp peak. This peak precisely coincides with the abrupt drop in the order parameter ⟨𝛷⟩ that
characterizes the transition in this regime, for both L=32 and L=64. This confirms that our methodology is robust across different
dynamical regimes.
Furthermore, we conducted a stringent test of the model’s cross-domain generalization capability. We used the original model,
trained only on low-density (𝜌 = 0.5) data, to analyze the high-density (𝜌 = 2.0) trajectories. The results, shown in the right panels
(b, d), are striking. Even without exposure to high-density dynamics during training, the original model still correctly identifies
the critical region, with its Var(𝐻) peak aligning with the order parameter’s drop. This remarkable generalization suggests that the
sequence model is not merely memorizing patterns specific to one type of transition. Instead, it appears to have learned a more
abstract feature of the order–disorder transition, one that is shared between the distinct dynamical regimes of 𝜌 = 0.5 and 𝜌 = 2.0.
The full extent of this transferability remains a subject for future investigation.

The circular variance of angular increments (green, left axis) fails to show any distinct feature at the transition, instead increasing monotonically
with noise, while the order parameter (black, right axis) shows the transition. This highlights the necessity of our predictive modeling approach.

3.3. Finite-size scaling behavior
Finally, to investigate whether our indicator behaves as a robust physical observable, we examined its finite-size scaling (FSS)
properties in the low-density regime (𝜌 = 0.5). Fig. 3 presents the results across four system sizes, from L=32 to L=256.
Panel (a) displays the behavior of Var(𝐻). As the system size L increases, the peak in Var(𝐻) becomes progressively sharper,
and its position systematically shifts to higher noise values (from 𝜂 ≈ 2.0 for L=32 to 𝜂 ≈ 2.5 for L=256). For comparison, panel (b)
shows the behavior of the order parameter ⟨𝛷⟩, which exhibits the well-known sharpening of the transition curve with increasing
system size. This observed correspondence in scaling behavior between our single-agent indicator and the global order parameter
supports the physical relevance of our proposed metric.
4. Discussion
The results presented herein demonstrate the efficacy of utilizing the variance of predictive Shannon entropy, derived from a
sequence model processing single-agent trajectories, as a potent indicator for identifying the critical region in the Vicsek model. This
methodology achieves a key objective: detecting proximity to a phase transition without prior knowledge of the underlying control
parameter (𝜂) or the system’s global state.
4.1. Entropy variance as a signature of critical dynamics
The central observation is the pronounced peak in the average entropy variance Var(𝐻) near the established critical noise level
(𝜂 ≈ 2.0 for 𝐿 = 32). We interpret this peak as reflecting the heightened dynamical complexity and predictability fluctuations inherent
to critical phenomena. In the ordered (low 𝜂) and disordered (high 𝜂) phases, the system dynamics, while drastically different, are
relatively stable. In the ordered phase, particle movement is largely deterministic (following neighbors), leading to consistently low
predictive entropy. In the disordered phase, movement is highly stochastic but statistically uniform, resulting in consistently high
predictive entropy. In both stable phases, the variance of this entropy along a trajectory remains low.
Conversely, near the critical point, the system exhibits characteristics such as large-scale correlations, critical slowing down, and
potentially intermittent switching between more ordered and disordered configurations (especially prominent in finite systems or
near coexistence regions, as might be relevant for 𝜌 = 0.5 [11,50]). A single agent experiences these fluctuating collective dynamics

through its local interactions. The RWKV-7 model, attempting to predict the agent’s next move based on its history, consequently
faces rapidly changing levels of predictability. Its internal ‘‘belief state’’ about the likely future direction fluctuates significantly over
time — sometimes the local environment suggests order, sometimes disorder. This fluctuation in the model’s predictive certainty
manifests directly as a high variance in the output Shannon entropy sequence. Thus, Var(𝐻) serves as a proxy for the temporal
variability of the local dynamical predictability, which is maximized near the transition.
4.2. Inferring global state from local information
A significant implication of our findings is that substantial information about the collective state of the system, particularly its
proximity to criticality, is encoded within the long-term trajectory of just a single agent. This contrasts with traditional approaches
7

Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 681 (2026) 131077

T. Wu and Z. Han

that rely on calculating global order parameters (like polarization) requiring information from a large fraction, if not all, agents.
Our method demonstrates the potential for inferring macroscopic system properties from microscopic, local observations, which is
particularly valuable in scenarios where global data acquisition is infeasible or costly, a common situation in real-world complex
systems (e.g., tracking a single animal in a large group, observing one stock in a market). The use of a powerful sequence model like
RWKV-7 appears crucial for effectively extracting these subtle temporal patterns related to criticality from the single-agent data.
4.3. Validation against physical observables and benchmarks
A primary contribution of this work is the validation of our proposed indicator, Var(𝐻). As demonstrated in Fig. 1(a, c), for the
low-density regime, the peak of our single-agent metric aligns well with the critical region identified by the global order parameter
⟨𝛷⟩.
Furthermore, the necessity of a sophisticated predictive model is underscored by the failure of a simpler, statistically-motivated
benchmark. Fig. 1(b, d) shows that the circular variance of angular increments, while being a proper measure for angular data,
is insensitive to the critical transition and fails to produce any indicative signal. This highlights that the signature of criticality is
embedded in higher-order temporal patterns that can only be effectively extracted by a model trained to understand the underlying
dynamics.
4.4. Universality and generalization of the method
Our investigation into the high-density regime (𝜌 = 2.0) reveals the universality and generalization capabilities of our approach
(Fig. 2). First, when a new model is trained specifically on high-density data, the Var(𝐻) indicator once again successfully identifies
the critical region, marked by an abrupt drop in polarization. This demonstrates the universality of our methodology across different
dynamical regimes.
Second, we found that the original model trained solely on low-density data could also correctly identify the transition in the
high-density system. The full extent of this transferability remains a subject for future investigation.
4.5. Consistency with finite-size scaling theory
Finally, to assess whether our indicator behaves as a robust physical observable, we examined its finite-size scaling (FSS)
properties. The results for the low-density regime (𝜌 = 0.5) across four system sizes are presented in Fig. 3.
The behavior of our indicator is broadly consistent with the principles of statistical physics. As shown in panel (a), the most
prominent and systematic trend is the shift of the peak location in Var(𝐻) to higher noise values as the system size 𝐿 increases,
moving from 𝜂 ≈ 2.0 for L=32 to approximately 𝜂 ≈ 2.5 for L=256. While the shape and height of the peak also vary with system
size, the consistent rightward shift of the critical point estimate is a hallmark of finite-size scaling. This trend mirrors the behavior
of the global order parameter ⟨𝛷⟩ shown in panel (b), where the transition curve also shifts and sharpens with increasing 𝐿. This
correspondence in scaling behavior supports the physical relevance of our proposed single-agent metric.
4.6. Relation to other methods and potential advantages
Our approach offers a distinct alternative to traditional methods for detecting phase transitions. Unlike methods requiring
parameter scans and global order parameter calculations, it operates ‘‘blindly’’ on time series data. Compared to other timeseries analysis techniques sometimes used for criticality detection (e.g., Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) [51], analysis of
autocorrelation functions, or simpler variance measures on position/angle increments), our method leverages the predictive power
of a sophisticated sequence model. It quantifies fluctuations in the predictability of the dynamics, potentially capturing more complex
temporal structures and non-linear dependencies than simpler statistical measures. The RWKV model, trained autoregressively,
implicitly builds a model of the underlying dynamical process conditioned on the observed history. The entropy variance then
probes the stability of this learned model’s predictions over time. A key advantage is the potential applicability to systems where
the underlying equations or control parameters are unknown, relying solely on observed time series. However, direct quantitative
comparisons of sensitivity, data requirements, and robustness against different noise types between our method and established
time-series techniques remain an important direction for future work.
Our approach, centered on the variance of predictive entropy derived from a sequence model (RWKV-7), offers a distinct
perspective compared to traditional time-series analysis techniques often employed for detecting critical transitions or characterizing
complex dynamics. Standard methods frequently rely on calculating statistical properties directly from the observed time series itself.
For instance, increases in variance and lag-1 autocorrelation are widely recognized indicators associated with critical slowing down
near tipping points, often explored in the context of early warning signals (EWS) [29,52].
Other established techniques delve into different aspects of time series structure. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), for
example, focuses on quantifying long-range temporal correlations and their scaling behavior, which can change across different
dynamical regimes [51,53]. Alternatively, methods rooted in information theory, such as Permutation Entropy [54] or Sample
Entropy [55], aim to measure the complexity, regularity, or predictability inherent in the signal’s patterns.
In contrast to these approaches that directly analyze statistical moments, correlation structures, or complexity patterns within
the raw data, our methodology quantifies the fluctuations in the predictability of the dynamics as perceived by a trained sequence
8

T. Wu and Z. Han

model. The model is trained autoregressively to learn the underlying process generating the single-agent trajectory across different
(unknown) noise levels. The resulting indicator, Var(𝐻), captures the temporal variability of the model’s certainty (inverse entropy)
about the agent’s immediate future state. We hypothesize that this focus on the dynamics of predictability makes our method
particularly sensitive to the critical region, where an agent experiences rapidly changing local environments fluctuating between
more ordered and disordered configurations, leading to significant variations in short-term predictability.
A key potential advantage stems from leveraging a powerful sequence model capable of capturing potentially complex, nonlinear, and long-range temporal dependencies that might be missed by simpler statistical measures. The model implicitly builds a
representation of the dynamics conditioned on the observed history, and the entropy variance probes the stability and consistency
of this learned representation over time along a trajectory. Furthermore, as demonstrated, this approach operates ‘‘blindly’’ using
only single-agent data, without requiring knowledge of the control parameter (𝜂) or access to global system information, addressing
key limitations of traditional phase transition analysis in potentially data-scarce or parameter-unknown real-world scenarios.
Nevertheless, direct quantitative comparisons concerning the sensitivity, data requirements (e.g., minimum time series length,
sampling frequency), computational cost, and robustness against observational noise or different system types between our predictive
entropy variance method and established techniques like those cited above [52–54] are warranted. Such comparative studies
represent an important avenue for future work to precisely delineate the relative strengths and weaknesses and the optimal
application domains for each approach in the analysis of complex systems near criticality.
It is also worth noting a key aspect of our modeling choice: we did not impose any symmetry constraints on the model’s predictive
distributions. While one might intuitively assume that the prediction for the next angle should be centered around the current angle
of motion, the underlying dynamics of the Vicsek model are not necessarily symmetric. The alignment interaction introduces a form
of temporal persistence or ‘‘momentum’’, meaning the particle is often more likely to continue turning in the same direction than to
reverse its turn. An unconstrained sequence model like RWKV-7 is free to learn these inherent asymmetries from the data. Imposing
a symmetry constraint would have forced the model to ignore this crucial information, likely degrading its ability to accurately
model the trajectory and, consequently, to detect the subtle fluctuations in predictability that signal criticality.

4.7. Limitations and future directions
Despite the promising results presented, several limitations warrant discussion, alongside fruitful avenues for future research.
Firstly, the findings may exhibit some dependence on the specific sequence model employed. While the RWKV-7 architecture proved
effective here, further investigation using alternative models, such as LSTMs or Transformers, would be valuable to determine if
the observed entropy variance peak is a general property of predictive models applied to critical dynamics or specific to certain
architectures. Closely related is the sensitivity to model hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, hidden dimensions) and the
specifics of the training regime, which merit systematic exploration. Secondly, the data requirements for robust detection need
further characterization. The optimal time series length (𝑇𝑠𝑒𝑞 ) and sampling frequency (𝛥𝑡𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 ) likely depend on the system’s
intrinsic timescales, particularly near the critical point due to critical slowing down. Similarly, the influence of the chosen
preprocessing steps, such as the EMA smoothing window (𝑊𝐸𝑀𝐴 ) and the angle discretization level (𝑁𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑠 ), should be systematically
assessed for their impact on the results.
Furthermore, the scope of our method’s applicability warrants broader validation. While this work has demonstrated success
for the stochastic Vicsek model across two density regimes, its performance on other collective motion paradigms remains to
be explored. This includes models with different interaction rules, such as those incorporating explicit attraction and repulsion
forces. More fundamentally, an important future direction is to test the method on deterministic chaotic systems, in contrast to
the stochastic systems studied here. For instance, agent-based models that are deterministic yet exhibit complex collective behavior
and phase transitions (such as certain variants of the Couzin model [56] or the three-zone model) would provide a stringent test
case. It is an open question whether the fluctuation in predictability, as captured by Var(𝐻), can serve as a universal indicator of
criticality in systems where the unpredictability stems from deterministic chaos rather than explicit stochastic noise. A crucial next
step also involves applying the methodology to real-world empirical data from systems like animal groups or pedestrian flows, which
present additional challenges such as measurement noise and non-stationarity. The computational cost associated with training deep
sequence models, although inference is generally efficient, must also be considered as a practical factor, especially when compared
to computationally cheaper traditional statistical measures.
Finally, deeper theoretical understanding and more rigorous quantitative analysis represent important future directions. While
we offer a plausible interpretation centered on predictability fluctuations, investigating the internal representations learned by the
RWKV model, potentially using techniques from explainable AI [57], could provide more concrete insights into how the model
discerns critical dynamics. Additionally, a detailed quantitative study of the scaling properties of the entropy variance peak –
examining how its height, width, and location scale with system size 𝐿 – could establish more rigorous connections to critical
exponents and universality classes, further solidifying the link between this data-driven indicator and fundamental concepts in
statistical physics. Addressing these points will be crucial for establishing the broader applicability and theoretical underpinnings
of using predictive entropy variance for criticality detection.

5. Conclusion
In this study, we have introduced and validated a novel, data-driven methodology for the blind identification of critical transitions
in collective motion systems. By applying a sequence model (RWKV-7) to analyze single-agent trajectories, we have shown that the
variance of the model’s predictive Shannon entropy, Var(𝐻), serves as a robust and effective indicator of criticality. Our approach
circumvents the need for prior knowledge of control parameters or access to global system information, two significant challenges
in the study of many real-world complex systems.
Our principal findings are threefold. First, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our indicator in the low-density Vicsek model.
The peak of Var(𝐻) accurately pinpoints the critical region identified by the global order parameter, whereas a benchmark based on
circular variance fails to do so. This result highlights the necessity of a predictive modeling approach to extract the subtle statistical
signatures of criticality.
Second, we established the universality and cross-regime generalization of our method. The indicator successfully identifies the
critical point not only in the low-density regime but also in the high-density regime. Furthermore, a model trained exclusively on
low-density data was able to generalize and correctly locate the transition in the high-density system, suggesting that the model
captures a universal feature of the order–disorder transition.
Finally, we confirmed the physical consistency and cross-size generalization of our indicator. A single model, trained only on
data from the smallest system (L=32), successfully revealed the finite-size scaling of the critical point across a range of larger system
sizes up to L=256. The indicator’s peak exhibits systematic shifts and sharpening consistent with the behavior of established physical
observables, establishing it as a robust, data-driven physical quantity that generalizes well across scales.
In conclusion, this work demonstrates that significant information about a system’s collective state is encoded in the temporal
dynamics of a single constituent, and that this information can be effectively decoded using modern sequence models. Our proposed
indicator, the predictive entropy variance, offers a practical tool for analyzing complex systems where traditional analysis methods
are challenging to apply.
