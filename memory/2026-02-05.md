# 2026-02-05 Daily Log

- Defined the reader-facing project intent and requirements in `AGENTS.md`, and drafted scenario/algorithm guidance docs under `doc/`.
- Implemented a runnable Python simulation (2D continuous) with `uv` environment management:
  - Evader local-policy baseline with tunable `w_align`.
  - Pursuer baseline policy `p0_nearest`.
  - Safe zones with slow motion (G0), unknown capacity, disappear-on-full, and refresh with `K_active_max`.
- Added CLI for running episodes, parameter sweeps, and generating aggregated reports with plots.
- Ran fixed-`N_p` sweeps over `(v_p/v_e, w_align)` and generated aggregated figures and a reader-facing results summary in `doc/`.

- Expanded fixed-`N_p` grid scan and added a “criticality proxy” `χ = N_e · Var_t(P(t))`, plus plots:
  - Raw sweep: `runs/sweep_20260205_154643_grid/` (1575 runs)
  - Aggregated: `doc/results_20260205_fixedNp_scan_expanded/`
  - Reader-facing summary updated: `doc/实验结果-固定追捕者数量扫描.md`
- Added sweep progress logging with ETA (`progress.jsonl`, `progress.txt`) and improved simulation throughput by optimizing neighbor interactions.
- Pushed all changes to GitHub `origin/main` (commits through `5ed3dec` and subsequent small documentation commits).

- Added noise-based tooling:
  - `phase-sweep-noise` for phase identification (no pursuers, no safe zones; scan `angle_noise`)
  - `sweep-noise` for task validation (scan `v_p/v_e × angle_noise`)
  - `report-noise` for plots and markdown summaries
- Ran a phase identification sweep showing χ peaking near `angle_noise≈1.8 rad` in the isolated setting:
  - Raw: `runs/sweep_20260205_171832_phase_noise/`
  - Aggregated: `doc/results_20260205_phase_noise_wider/`
- Ran a task noise sweep (fixed `N_p=2`, `w_align=1.0`) showing best `safe_frac` at low noise rather than near the phase-identified χ peak:
  - Raw: `runs/sweep_20260205_172202_noise/`
  - Aggregated: `doc/results_20260205_task_noise_walign1/`
  - Reader-facing analysis: `doc/实验结果-临界性验证-噪声控制参.md`
