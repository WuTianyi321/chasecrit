# 2026-02-05 Daily Log

- Defined the reader-facing project intent and requirements in `AGENTS.md`, and drafted scenario/algorithm guidance docs under `doc/`.
- Implemented a runnable Python simulation (2D continuous) with `uv` environment management:
  - Evader local-policy baseline with tunable `w_align`.
  - Pursuer baseline policy `p0_nearest`.
  - Safe zones with slow motion (G0), unknown capacity, disappear-on-full, and refresh with `K_active_max`.
- Added CLI for running episodes, parameter sweeps, and generating aggregated reports with plots.
- Ran fixed-`N_p` sweeps over `(v_p/v_e, w_align)` and generated aggregated figures and a reader-facing results summary in `doc/`.
